**Project Development:** Eclipse

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JSP

**Backend:** Java Programming Language, Java Server Pages

**Database used:** MySQL Database

**Local Server used:** Tomcat Server

**Automatic License Plate Recognition API used.**

**New Maven Project has been created and used in Eclipse IDE**

**Automatic License Plate Recognition API** is being used in this project for recognition of the registration number in License plates in Vehicles with Higher Accuracy and also works well with low-resolution images, vehicle license plate recognition at night, etc. Since this API gives output of recognition of the registration number in License plates in Vehicles with Higher Accuracy this API is used in the project. 

Workflow of the Project:
First we land on to the **index.jsp** page and we enter the email and password and in backend it is checked and it redirects to optionspage.jsp. For now at backend it checks whether the email is admin@project.com and passworsd is admin.

In **optionspage.jsp** there are two options, where in first option we can upload vehicle photo and second option is used to view previously detected vehicle registration number.
